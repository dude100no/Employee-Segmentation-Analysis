# Employee-Segmentation-Analysis
Part of my AIML CA2 assignment. The objective was to perform segmentation on some employee data. After the segmentation, I would need to determine which group of employees is the most vulnerable (most likely to resign). 

### What I have learnt:
1. Using snake plots to determine the contribution of the feature to the segmentation of each cluster.
2. Using Gower Dissimilarity to deal with a dataset with a mixture of categorical and numerical data.
3. The pros and cons of the basic clustering models from sklearn.
